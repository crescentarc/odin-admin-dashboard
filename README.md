# odin-admin-dashboard

Ealrier on in my programming studies, I learned and practiced the use of Flexbox in order to make organized page layouts. It wasn't until the calulator project where I was first exposed to CSS Grid. That language was particularly helpful in arranging the buttons on the calculator. Now that I've formally learned about Grid, I'll now be using my knowledge to use by creating a mock-up admin dashboard. 

From what I've seen with example dashboards, these sorts of webpages not only feature sections layed out by columns and rows, but even those sections have their own columns and rows for storing additional information. I've had experience in making flex items into flex containers, so I hope to be able to achieve similar results with CSS Grid. By the end of this project, I hope that my ability to make organized webpage layouts will be more refined. 

May 6th update:
This was a much more involved project than I imagined, not just due to how many grids and sub-grids (sub-flex boxes in some cases) went into making it, but also due to how much I of CSS I was able to review. 

For instance, I learned that it's possible to render a box shadow to be inside of a box's border (inset) which is how I was able to have the project boxes have an inner black border box shadow. Another thing that came in handy was setting a specific size for the svg icons so that they would be consistently sized regardless of the screen size. 

When it comes to the main focus of this project, grid, I can certainly understand why a lot of people say grid should be used when you plan the layout before the content. Setting the grid boxes with background colors before inserting any content helped me to slowly but surely complete the layout of the admin dashboard, one section at a time. Once I get around to making my own personal site, I know I'll be making good use of this to create each section.
